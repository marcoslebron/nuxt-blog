## About me
My name is Marcos, I am a self-taught frontend developer, how did I start? ... Good question, the truth was a roller coaster with highs and lows, frustrations, sleepless nights and so on, but not everything was bad, many good things happened too.

But I tell you it all started when the multimedia technologist finished a superior technical program that lasts about 3 years in a technological institute of my country, by then I had a job as a digitizer in a library, a few months later a career partner contacted me to fill a vacancy where he was working as a web designer.

I was interviewed and everything was fine. Ah! I had to know English (thank God I have a very picky mother and since I was 10 years old I had studied English) and you know, I knew nothing about the interview.

In that year and couple of months I became more and more interested in how to make web designs to HTML (which is called layout). That's how I started back then: I paid for a treehouse membership, in the office they allowed me to study about 2 hours a day when there was nothing to do. So I stayed for a while until I can have a more or less decent portfolio.

A few months later, a colleague had a friend who told him about how he works from home (if from home!), I was amazed, that was in mid-July 2016, if I remember correctly.

I was totally intrigued üßê about this world of freelance that I totally did not know so I tried to get more information about it, which my partner later provided. That's where we talked about upwork, so I said ok I will create a profile to see how it goes.

After I had my profile ready, it was only a matter of applying to existing project offers and expecting positive responses. After 2 weeks I already had my freelance part-time job and after 2 months üéØ I quit the company where I was and started working full remote.

The transition from being an ordinary employee to being a full-time freelancer was not easy at all ... !! It was the jump! A 180 degree turn, can you imagine!?, The most complicated thing was to manage time and keep my knowledge up to international demand was not a simple task either ... But ... how did I achieve it? focusing 100% on what I wanted. The first thing I did when I woke up was to open my computer and start studying in blogs, online courses (I bought several), sometimes I spent so many hours studying and practicing that I forgot to have lunch ... can you imagine it? no right? I really went to the extreme, as Blaise Pascal would say: "The extremes touch" and that was my daily bread :)

I think the most important of all is that I learned from mistakes and that I am here and decided to share my story.

They will ask why do you create this blog? The reason is very simple as I had many questions in this way of which I had not the slightest idea how to achieve maybe you too or maybe you just want to learn together with me üöÄ.
